For this final project, I performed a straightforward analysis using the pre-processed
Kaggle dataset that our instructor provided. I combined the knowledge from our
previous lessons, the code found in online Kaggle sharing resources for the project,
and insights from AI tools.

This project investigates student social media addiction. The dataset included various
factors such as nationality, gender, age, academic level, and average social media
usage time. My analysis focused on four main areas: the age demographics of
platform users, the distribution of academic levels within the dataset, the gender ratio,
and the differences in social media usage patterns between genders. Throughout this
course, our instructor equipped us with a range of techniques and valuable resources.
By creating statistical plots with Python, I was able to pinpoint specific
characteristics of different demographics, which allowed for a more adaptable
analysis.

I particularly enjoyed using Jupyter Notebook for this project. Its ability to let me
write notes and execute code in real-time was incredibly helpful, and I found its
interface very intuitive. This course significantly broadened my understanding of how
to apply Python in practical scenarios, and I also learned more streamlined coding
methods from exploring other online projects.
